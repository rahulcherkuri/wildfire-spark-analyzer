# Contributing to Wildfire Geospatial Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this emergency response analytics project! 

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Set up the development environment** following the README installation guide
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
4. **Make your changes** with appropriate tests
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## 🧪 Testing

Run the full test suite before submitting:
```bash
mvn clean test
mvn package
```

## 🐛 Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Environment details** (Java version, Spark version, OS)
- **Sample data** that reproduces the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Error logs** with full stack traces

## 🌟 Feature Requests

For new features:
- **Describe the emergency response use case**
- **Explain the expected impact** on wildfire analysis
- **Consider performance implications** for large datasets
- **Provide example usage** scenarios

## 📊 Data Contributions

When contributing sample datasets:
- **Ensure data privacy** - no personal/sensitive information
- **Document data sources** and collection methods
- **Include metadata** about environmental variables
- **Verify geospatial accuracy** of coordinate systems

## 💡 Emergency Response Focus

This project serves emergency responders and at-risk communities. Contributions should prioritize:
- **Life safety applications**
- **Real-time processing capabilities** 
- **Accuracy and reliability**
- **Scalability for crisis situations**

## 📝 Code Style

- Follow existing **Scala conventions**
- Use **meaningful variable names** 
- Add **comprehensive comments** for complex geospatial operations
- Include **performance considerations** in commit messages

## 🚨 Critical Path

Some areas require extra attention:
- **Geospatial calculations** - accuracy is vital for emergency response
- **Performance optimizations** - must handle crisis-scale data volumes
- **Error handling** - system must be robust during emergencies
- **Documentation** - clarity helps emergency responders deploy quickly

Every contribution could help save lives during wildfire emergencies. Thank you for your commitment to community safety! 🔥🚒
